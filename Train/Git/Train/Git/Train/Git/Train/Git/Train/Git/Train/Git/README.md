# GameOfLife

This is an implementation of game of life with Python.
It has a console version and UI version made with Tk.

I'm currently working on patterns preview and world state edit.

# V0.2
Add patterns preview in UI and a patternsLoader module.
All the patterns are stored in folder 'patterns'.

# V0.1
A basic GameOfLife world.
